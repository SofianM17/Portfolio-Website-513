            To help me remain active given the time I regularly spend at my desk learning and programming, 
            I enjoy <span style="color:#2caeba; font-weight: bold;"> snowboarding </span> to not only get the exercise, but also to take in the fresh mountain breeze
            and the stunning views of the mountain landscape that forms the Rockies.

            During the summer, when snowpacks are limited to only the mountaintops of the highest peaks in
            Western Canada, I enjoy <span style="color:#2caeba; font-weight: bold;"> hiking </span> and traversing trails that take me through the wilderness and 
            culminate in spectacular views.

            As an outlet for creativity, I enjoy <span style="color:#2caeba; font-weight: bold;"> taking photos </span> , many of which I take on the hikes that I do;
            I equally enjoy <span style="color:#2caeba; font-weight: bold;"> recording and editing videos </span> through which I am able to creatively capture, keep a record of, and
            share the unique experiences that I have had.
